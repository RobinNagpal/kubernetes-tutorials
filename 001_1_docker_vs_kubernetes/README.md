Docker vs Kubernetes || Apple vs Apple Pie

# First things first
It's never docker vs kubernetes, its mostly docker and Kubernetes. Both of them work at different levels. 

Apple vs Apple Pie
Right question can be "Apple Pie vs Blueberry Pie" or "Apple vs Blueberry"
Since apple is an ingredient of apple pie, they both are at different levels

Docker -> Containers -> Apple
Kubernetes -> Container orchestration and management software -> Apple Pie

Like we have Apple in Apple pie, we similarly use docker in Kubernetes

Of course there can be different type of fruits, similarly there can be different container runtimes 
like docker and other is rktlet(rkt)

And there can be many type of pies, similarly there can be different container management and orchestration softwares
like Kubernetes and other is Docker Swarm

* Application contains different application modules
    - Frontend
    - Backend Server
    - Database
  You create containers for all these. This is like your apples  
*  To be able to deploy your app, you need other things like
    - Load balancing
    - Monitoring
    - Scaling
    - Storage
  This is like needing other ingredients like flour, sugar 
  
* You put this all together and it becomes a production ready app. You put this all together and deploy it to Kubernetes
  Some of the things here you get free in Kubernetes like 
  - Load balancing
  - Monitoring
  - Scaling
  You have to buy certain things like servers where Kubernetes runs, storage for which you can use any cloud provider like AWS, Google, Azure, DigitalOcean

Similarly, putting all the things together you get apple pie. There are somethings in your kitchen already like Flour, Sugar. 
But you might have to grocery store to buy things like Vanilla Extract.
